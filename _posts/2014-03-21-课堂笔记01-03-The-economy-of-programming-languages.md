---



   * why are there so many programming languages?


            application needs: distinctive, conflicating
            e.g.:1)scientific computing.(good fp, good arrays, parallelism)   FOR-TRAN
                    2)business applications(persistence, data analysis, report generation)  SQL
                    3)systems programming(control of resources, real time constraints)  C/C++

   * why are there new programming languages?

           productivity > training cost
           new programming comes because technology changes, internet and java.
           new languages tend to look like old languages, java vs c++

   * what is a good programming language?

          There is no universally accepted metric for language design.
          A good language is one people use?

          if you say if many people use that language then, that’s good language.

                    VB is the best language?.


Create a new language to accommodate the system need, but not accommodate the system to the old system, so new programming language comes!
